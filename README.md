## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (I learn that version control systems make life easier for developers. It allows for files to be shared, altered, and manipulated all while remaining secure. This allows for developer collaboration and gives devlopers the chance to quickly and easily change and share their projects.)
2. (I learned about how easy GIT is for users. It allows for different types of files, very small to very large, to be handled. GIT is very quick, simple to use, and allows for devlopers to shore their files locally for easy access.)
3. (I learned that the internet may seem like a very big and confusing place but systems such as GIT have been created to make it much easier for users. The fact that a system such as GIT has been created allows for users to get what they need done quickly and breaks down what seems to be complicated into an easy to manage system.)
